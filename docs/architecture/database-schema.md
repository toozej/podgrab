    P --> E2[Episode 2<br/>id: 750e8400<br/>podcast_id: 550e8400]
    P --> E3[Episode N<br/>id: 850e8400<br/>podcast_id: 550e8400]

    style P fill:#FFD700
    style E1 fill:#90EE90
    style E2 fill:#90EE90
    style E3 fill:#90EE90
```

**Query**: Get all episodes for a podcast
```sql
SELECT * FROM podcast_items
WHERE podcast_id = '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000'
AND deleted_at IS NULL
ORDER BY pub_date DESC;
```

### Many-to-Many: Podcasts ↔ Tags

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Podcasts
        P1[Podcast 1]
        P2[Podcast 2]
        P3[Podcast 3]
    end

    subgraph "Join Table: podcast_tags"
        J1[P1 - Tech]
        J2[P1 - News]
        J3[P2 - News]
        J4[P3 - Tech]
    end

    subgraph Tags
        T1[Tech]
        T2[News]
    end

    P1 --> J1 & J2
    P2 --> J3
    P3 --> J4

    J1 & J4 --> T1
    J2 & J3 --> T2

    style Podcasts fill:#FFD700
    style Tags fill:#90EE90
    style "Join Table: podcast_tags" fill:#87CEEB
```

**Query**: Get all podcasts with "Tech" tag
```sql
SELECT p.* FROM podcasts p
INNER JOIN podcast_tags pt ON p.id = pt.podcast_id
INNER JOIN tags t ON pt.tag_id = t.id
WHERE t.label = 'Tech'
AND p.deleted_at IS NULL;
```

## Common Queries

### Dashboard Statistics

```sql
-- Get podcast counts by download status
SELECT
    p.id,
    p.title,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN pi.download_status = 2 THEN 1 END) as downloaded,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN pi.download_status = 0 THEN 1 END) as pending,
    COUNT(*) as total,
    SUM(CASE WHEN pi.download_status = 2 THEN pi.file_size ELSE 0 END) as total_size
FROM podcasts p
LEFT JOIN podcast_items pi ON p.id = pi.podcast_id AND pi.deleted_at IS NULL
WHERE p.deleted_at IS NULL
GROUP BY p.id;
```

### Recent Episodes

```sql
-- Get 50 most recent episodes across all podcasts
SELECT
    pi.*,
    p.title as podcast_title,
    p.image as podcast_image
FROM podcast_items pi
INNER JOIN podcasts p ON pi.podcast_id = p.id
WHERE pi.deleted_at IS NULL
AND p.deleted_at IS NULL
ORDER BY pi.pub_date DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

### Download Queue

```sql
-- Get next episodes to download
SELECT pi.*, p.title as podcast_title
FROM podcast_items pi
INNER JOIN podcasts p ON pi.podcast_id = p.id
WHERE pi.download_status = 0  -- NotDownloaded
AND pi.deleted_at IS NULL
AND p.is_paused = 0
AND p.deleted_at IS NULL
ORDER BY pi.pub_date DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Data Integrity Rules

### Soft Deletes

All main tables use soft deletes via `deleted_at`:
- NULL = active record
- NOT NULL = logically deleted

**Always include in queries**:
```sql
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
```

### Cascade Deletes

When deleting podcasts:
1. Set `podcast_items.deleted_at` for all episodes
2. Delete from `podcast_tags` join table
3. Set `podcasts.deleted_at`

Actual files remain until explicitly deleted via "Delete Files" action.

### Unique Constraints

- `podcasts.url`: One entry per RSS feed
- `tags.label`: One tag per name
- `podcast_items.guid + podcast_id`: One episode per podcast
- `settings.id`: Singleton table

## Performance Considerations

### Query Optimization

**Fast Queries** (indexed):
- Get podcast by ID
- Get episodes by podcast_id
- Get episodes by download_status
- Sort by created_at, pub_date, last_episode

**Slower Queries** (full scan):
- Search podcast titles (LIKE)
- Search episode summaries (LIKE)
- Complex tag filtering

### Database Size Estimation

**Typical Podcast**:
- 1 Podcast record: ~1 KB
- 100 Episodes: ~50 KB
- Total: ~51 KB

**Large Collection (100 podcasts, 10,000 episodes)**:
- Database size: ~5-10 MB
- Add indexes: ~2-5 MB
- Total: ~10-15 MB

SQLite performs well with databases up to several GB.

## Backup Strategy

**Automated Backups**:
- Frequency: Every 2 days (configurable via `CHECK_FREQUENCY`)
- Location: `{CONFIG}/backups/`
- Format: SQLite database file copy
- Retention: Manual cleanup required

**Manual Backup**:
```bash
sqlite3 /config/podgrab.db ".backup /config/backups/manual-backup.db"
```

## Migration Strategy

**Current Approach**: GORM AutoMigrate
- Runs on application startup
- Adds new columns/tables automatically
- Does NOT remove columns (safe)
- Does NOT alter column types (requires manual migration)

**Manual Migrations**: Handled in `db/migrations.go`
