## Notes

- All timestamps are in ISO 8601 format with UTC timezone
- UUIDs are used for all resource identifiers
- File sizes are in bytes
- Durations are in seconds
- Some endpoints use GET for state-changing operations (legacy design)
- Background operations (downloads, refreshes) return immediately and process asynchronously
